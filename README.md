# Obsidian-extension
A script to access obsidian notes from a central server by clients on a network

As part of scripting and adding custom features to my striiped windows 10, Working from a VM, I need to get information from my Obsidian notes on my ost machine.
Moving to and fro in tabs and programs was tideous so I decided to crete a solution resulting to this. 

As a result, some of the details (such as IP address, Port numbers, directories) are static which can be modified as suited.
